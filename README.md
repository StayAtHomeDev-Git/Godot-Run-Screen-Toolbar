# Run Screen Toolbar
I got tired of constantly having to go into the Editor Settings to switch between screens and fullscreen when running a scene in the engine.  I use different screens for recording tutorials or working on a project depending on the workflow.  So I created a quick toolbar to switch between my three screens and to turn fullscreen off and on.
