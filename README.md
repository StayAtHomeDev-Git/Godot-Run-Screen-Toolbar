# Run Screen Toolbar
I got tired of constantly having to go into the Editor Settings to switch between screens and fullscreen when running a scene in the engine.  I use different screens for recording tutorials or working on a project depending on the workflow.  So I created a quick toolbar to switch between my three screens and to turn fullscreen off and on.

## Features

- Quickly switch between Screen 1, 2, and 3 (if you have 3 screens)
- Toggle Fullscreen
- Toolbar reflects current setting on startup
- Toolbar updates if changes are made in the Editor Settings directly

## To-Do

- Beautify code
- Make toolbar aware of number of actual screens (Hard-coded for three currently)
- Possibly add more settings (resolution, etc)
